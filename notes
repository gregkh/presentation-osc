  Why?

  They all are doing stuff to Linux to support what they need from Linux.  And they do so in a way that helps everyone else out as well.

  Linux is evolution, not intellegent design - Linus

  Because of this, Linux works better than any other operating system ever has, for more different types of devices and processors.


  "Linux is the only OS that will run on architectures that haven't been invented yet" - - Dr. Irving Wladawsky-Berger IBM

  "Linux took over Wall Street because it moved faster than anyone else." - lots of financial developers

  Enterprise distros - trying to recapture Solaris's release model.  Change every 2 years.

  Great for some markets, not good for others.

  "Change is the only constant" - Heraclitus (greek philosopher)

  Back to openSUSE

  our release cycles are now 8 months long, giving the developers time
  to work on integrating major new features in a much more relaxed
  manner to make things work better together.

  But what about users who need the change that has happened with Linux
  over the past 8 months (i.e. new hardware, new features, bugfixes)?

  Tumbleweed is the solution for that, a "rolling" stable release based
  on the last stable openSUSE release.

  What it is not:
    - a totally new distro
    - a replacement for the openSUSE releases
    - a replacement for FACTORY

  What it is:
    - an addition on top of the last openSUSE release
    - stable packages cherry-picked from FACTORY are backported

  How to use it:
    - read wiki
    - use one-click-install file
    - 'zypper dup'
    - no repo priorities

  Requirements of a package to get into Tumbleweed:
    - package is already in openSUSE:Factory
    - maintainer agrees it can be there

  How to get a package into Tumbleweed:
    - do a submitreq for the package to openSUSE:Tumbleweed:Testing
    - or email me, or the opensuse-factory mailing list and ask


  How it works:

    - packages are linked back to the original repository in their
      "base", or in openSUSE:Factory, depending on the package.
    - first checked into openSUSE:Tumbleweed:Testing and verified that
      they work properly (i.e. my machine boots!)
    - checked into openSUSE:Tumbleweed
